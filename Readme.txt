This plugin allows you to control a dome rotation using an Advanced Motion Controls DigiFlex Performance servo drive controller ( something like https://www.a-m-c.com/products/?page=product&cid=servo-drives&id=DPRAHIE-015S400 ). This was request as a custom plugin and assume the controller has been configured with AMC own software prior to using the plugin.

Pre-compiled versions for OS X, Windows, Unbuntu X86_64 and Rapsberry Pi Pixel can be found there :
